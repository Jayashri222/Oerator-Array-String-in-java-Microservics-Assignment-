     Operator , Array , String in Java
Q 1. List the  operators in java.
Ans: 1.Arithmetic Operator:
           Add : x+y
          Subtract: x-y
          Multiply: x*y
          Divide: x/y
           Modulus:x%y
       2.Assignment Operator
        It is used to assign value to variable.
           x=10
           x+=5 ->x=x+5
       3.Relational Operator
         >,<,>=,<=,==
      4.Logical Operator
       &&,||,!
        5.Bitwise Operator
          &,|
Q.2 Explain about increment and decrement with example.
Ans : Increment and decrement operations are used to increase and decrease value by one.
Denoted by: ++(increment)    - - (decrement)
Example:
  int a=10;
  a++ -> 11  //a=a+1
  a- -  → 10  //a=a-1
Q.3 What are conditional operator in java?
Ans:Conditional operator is used to check condition and decide the result on given condition.
Conditional And=&&
Conditional Or=||
Ternary=?:
int x=5, y=4, z=7;  
System.out.println(x>y && x>z || y<z);  //true
System.out.println((x<z || y>z) && x<y);  //false
Q. 4 What are the type of operator based on number of operand?
Ans : Two types operator
1. Binary operator : Two operand (+,-,*,/)
2. Unary Operator: One Operand(++,--)
Q 5.What are conditional statement and its use in java?
Ans: In java, a conditional statement is a programming construct that allows you to execute different blocks of code based on certain condition.
The most common types of conditional statement in java are if,else if,else.
Int a=10;
if(a>20){
     System.out.println(a);
}
Q.6 What is the syntax of if else statement?
Ans:   Syntax:
      if(condition){
           //if true  execute this block
}
else{
   //If false execute this block
}
Example:
Int a=20;
if(a>10){
 System.out.println(“hello”);
}
else{
    System.out.println(“hello”);
}
Q.7 What are the three types of iterative statement in java?
Ans: The three iterative statement in java are:
1.  For loop
2. While loop
3. Do while loop
Q 8. What do you mean by array?
Ans:  Array is a collection of elements of single data type , stored in continuous memory location.
Q 9. How to create array?
Ans:  Creation of Array
        Data_type  [ ] array_name=new data_type[size]
Int [ ] arr=new int[3]
It is array of size 3;
   or
Int [ ] arr={1,3,4,6}
   or
Int  [ ]a;
a=new int[5];
Q.10 Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in java?
Ans : StringBuffer is thread safe,it is synchronized, and multiple threads can safely use it concurrently without causing any issue related to data consistency.
StringBuilder is not thread safe , it is not synchronized so, if multiple threads access concurrently its contents,it can lead to data corruption.
